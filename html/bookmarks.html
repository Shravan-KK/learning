    <h2 id="mathematics">MATHEMATICS</h2>
    <p>Mathematics is an area of knowledge that includes the topics of numbers, formulas and related structures, shapes
        and the spaces in which they are contained, and quantities and their changes. These topics are represented in
        modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines of number theory,[1] algebra,[2] geometry,[1] and
        analysis,[3][4] respectively. There is no general consensus among mathematicians about a common definition for
        their academic discipline.

        Most mathematical activity involves the discovery of properties of abstract objects and the use of pure reason
        to prove them. These objects consist of either abstractions from nature or—in modern mathematics—entities that
        are stipulated to have certain properties, called axioms. A proof consists of a succession of applications of
        deductive rules to already established results. These results include previously proved theorems, axioms, and—in
        case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are considered true starting points of the theory
        under consideration.[5]Mathematics is essential in the natural sciences, engineering, medicine, finance, computer science and the social sciences. Although mathematics is extensively used for modeling phenomena, the fundamental truths of mathematics are independent from any scientific experimentation. Some areas of mathematics, such as statistics and game theory, are developed in close correlation with their applications and are often grouped under applied mathematics. Other areas are developed independently from any application (and are therefore called pure mathematics), but often later find practical applications.[6][7] The problem of integer factorization, for example, which goes back to Euclid in 300 BC, had no practical application before its use in the RSA cryptosystem, now widely used for the security of computer networks.

        Historically, the concept of a proof and its associated mathematical rigour first appeared in Greek mathematics, most notably in Euclid's Elements.[8] Since its beginning, mathematics was essentially divided into geometry and arithmetic (the manipulation of natural numbers and fractions), until the 16th and 17th centuries, when algebra[a] and infinitesimal calculus were introduced as new areas. Since then, the interaction between mathematical innovations and scientific discoveries has led to a rapid lockstep increase in the development of both.[9] At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis of mathematics led to the systematization of the axiomatic method,[10] which heralded a dramatic increase in the number of mathematical areas and their fields of application. The contemporary Mathematics Subject Classification lists more than 60 first-level areas of mathematics.
        
        Etymology
        The word mathematics comes from Ancient Greek máthēma (μάθημα), meaning "that which is learnt",[11] "what one gets to know", hence also "study" and "science". The word came to have the narrower and more technical meaning of "mathematical study" even in Classical times.[12] Its adjective is mathēmatikós (μαθηματικός), meaning "related to learning" or "studious", which likewise further came to mean "mathematical".[13] In particular, mathēmatikḗ tékhnē (μαθηματικὴ τέχνη; Latin: ars mathematica) meant "the mathematical art".[11]
        
        Similarly, one of the two main schools of thought in Pythagoreanism was known as the mathēmatikoi (μαθηματικοί)—which at the time meant "learners" rather than "mathematicians" in the modern sense. The Pythagoreans were likely the first to constrain the use of the word to just the study of arithmetic and geometry. By the time of Aristotle (384–322 BC) this meaning was fully established.[14]
        
        In Latin, and in English until around 1700, the term mathematics more commonly meant "astrology" (or sometimes "astronomy") rather than "mathematics"; the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about 1500 to 1800. This change has resulted in several mistranslations: For example, Saint Augustine's warning that Christians should beware of mathematici, meaning "astrologers", is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians.[15]
        
        The apparent plural form in English goes back to the Latin neuter plural mathematica (Cicero), based on the Greek plural ta mathēmatiká (τὰ μαθηματικά) and means roughly "all things mathematical", although it is plausible that English borrowed only the adjective mathematic(al) and formed the noun mathematics anew, after the pattern of physics and metaphysics, inherited from Greek.[16] In English, the noun mathematics takes a singular verb. It is often shortened to maths or, in North America, math.[17]
        
        Areas of mathematics
        Before the Renaissance, mathematics was divided into two main areas: arithmetic—regarding the manipulation of numbers, and geometry, regarding the study of shapes.[18] Some types of pseudoscience, such as numerology and astrology, were not then clearly distinguished from mathematics.[19]
        
        During the Renaissance, two more areas appeared. Mathematical notation led to algebra which, roughly speaking, consists of the study and the manipulation of formulas. Calculus, consisting of the two subfields differential calculus and integral calculus, is the study of continuous functions, which model the typically nonlinear relationships between varying quantities, as represented by variables. This division into four main areas–arithmetic, g .l;/k,pl[;ik,kpk, eometry, algebra, calculus[20]–endured until the end of the 19th century. Areas such as celestial mechanics and solid mechanics were then studied by mathematicians, but now are considered as belonging to physics.[21] The subject of combinatorics has been studied for much of recorded history, yet did not become a separate branch of mathematics until the seventeenth century.[22]
        
        At the end of the 19th century, the foundational crisis in mathematics and the resulting systematization of the axiomatic method led to an explosion of new areas of mathematics.[23][10] The 2020 Mathematics Subject Classification contains no less than sixty-three first-level areas.[24] Some of these areas correspond to the older division, as is true regarding number theory (the modern name for higher arithmetic) and geometry. Several other first-level areas have "geometry" in their names or are otherwise commonly considered part of geometry. Algebra and calculus do not appear as first-level areas but are respectively split into several first-level areas. Other first-level areas emerged during the 20th century or had not previously been considered as mathematics, such as mathematical logic and foundations.[25]</p>
    <h2 id="physics">PHYSICS</h2>
    <p>Physics is the natural science of matter, involving the study of matter,[a] its fundamental constituents, its
        motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.[2] Physics is one of
        the most fundamental scientific disciplines, with its main goal being to understand how the universe
        behaves.[b][3][4][5] A scientist who specializes in the field of physics is called a physicist.

        Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy, perhaps the
        oldest.[6] Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, and certain branches of mathematics
        were a part of natural philosophy, but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural
        sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.[c] Physics intersects with many
        interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, and the boundaries of physics are
        not rigidly defined. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences[3]
        and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.Advances in physics often enable advances in new technologies. For example, advances in the understanding of electromagnetism, solid-state physics, and nuclear physics led directly to the development of new products that have dramatically transformed modern-day society, such as television, computers, domestic appliances, and nuclear weapons;[3] advances in thermodynamics led to the development of industrialization; and advances in mechanics inspired the development of calculus.

        History
        Main article: History of physics
        The word "physics" originates from Ancient Greek: φυσική (ἐπιστήμη), romanized: physikḗ (epistḗmē), meaning "knowledge of nature".[8][9][10]
        
        Ancient astronomy
        Main article: History of astronomy
        
        Ancient Egyptian astronomy is evident in monuments like the ceiling of Senemut's tomb from the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt.
        Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. Early civilizations dating back before 3000 BCE, such as the Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilisation, had a predictive knowledge and a basic awareness of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. The stars and planets, believed to represent gods, were often worshipped. While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence, these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky,[6] which could not explain the positions of the planets.
        
        According to Asger Aaboe, the origins of Western astronomy can be found in Mesopotamia, and all Western efforts in the exact sciences are descended from late Babylonian astronomy.[11] Egyptian astronomers left monuments showing knowledge of the constellations and the motions of the celestial bodies,[12] while Greek poet Homer wrote of various celestial objects in his Iliad and Odyssey; later Greek astronomers provided names, which are still used today, for most constellations visible from the Northern Hemisphere.[13]
        
        Natural philosophy
        Main article: Natural philosophy
        Natural philosophy has its origins in Greece during the Archaic period (650 BCE – 480 BCE), when pre-Socratic philosophers like Thales rejected non-naturalistic explanations for natural phenomena and proclaimed that every event had a natural cause.[14] They proposed ideas verified by reason and observation, and many of their hypotheses proved successful in experiment;[15] for example, atomism was found to be correct approximately 2000 years after it was proposed by Leucippus and his pupil Democritus.[16]

    <h2 id="chemistry">CHEMISTRY</h2>
    <p>Chemistry is the scientific study of the properties and behavior of matter.[1] It is a physical science under
        natural sciences that covers the elements that make up matter to the compounds made of atoms, molecules and
        ions: their composition, structure, properties, behavior and the changes they undergo during a reaction with
        other substances.[2][3][4][5] Chemistry also addresses the nature of chemical bonds in chemical compounds.

        In the scope of its subject, chemistry occupies an intermediate position between physics and biology.[6] It is
        sometimes called the central science because it provides a foundation for understanding both basic and applied
        scientific disciplines at a fundamental level.[7] For example, chemistry explains aspects of plant growth
        (botany), the formation of igneous rocks (geology), how atmospheric ozone is formed and how environmental
        pollutants are degraded (ecology), the properties of the soil on the moon (cosmochemistry), how medications work
        (pharmacology), and how to collect DNA evidence at a crime scene (forensics).Etymology
        Main article: Etymology of chemistry
        The word chemistry comes from a modification during the Renaissance of the word alchemy, which referred to an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine. Alchemy is often associated with the quest to turn lead or other base metals into gold, though alchemists were also interested in many of the questions of modern chemistry.[8]
        
        The modern word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic word al-kīmīā (الكیمیاء). This may have Egyptian origins since al-kīmīā is derived from the Ancient Greek χημία, which is in turn derived from the word Kemet, which is the ancient name of Egypt in the Egyptian language.[9] Alternately, al-kīmīā may derive from χημεία 'cast together'.[10]
        
        Modern principles
        
        Laboratory, Institute of Biochemistry, University of Cologne in Germany
        The current model of atomic structure is the quantum mechanical model.[11] Traditional chemistry starts with the study of elementary particles, atoms, molecules,[12] substances, metals, crystals and other aggregates of matter. Matter can be studied in solid, liquid, gas and plasma states, in isolation or in combination. The interactions,[disambiguation needed] reactions and transformations that are studied in chemistry are usually the result of interactions between atoms, leading to rearrangements of the chemical bonds which hold atoms together. Such behaviors are studied in a chemistry laboratory.
        
        The chemistry laboratory stereotypically uses various forms of laboratory glassware. However glassware is not central to chemistry, and a great deal of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.
        
        
        Solutions of substances in reagent bottles, including ammonium hydroxide and nitric acid, illuminated in different colors
        A chemical reaction is a transformation of some substances into one or more different substances.[13] The basis of such a chemical transformation is the rearrangement of electrons in the chemical bonds between atoms. It can be symbolically depicted through a chemical equation, which usually involves atoms as subjects. The number of atoms on the left and the right in the equation for a chemical transformation is equal. (When the number of atoms on either side is unequal, the transformation is referred to as a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay.) The type of chemical reactions a substance may undergo and the energy changes that may accompany it are constrained by certain basic rules, known as chemical laws.
        
        Energy and entropy considerations are invariably important in almost all chemical studies. Chemical substances are classified in terms of their structure, phase, as well as their chemical compositions. They can be analyzed using the tools of chemical analysis, e.g. spectroscopy and chromatography. Scientists engaged in chemical research are known as chemists.[14] Most chemists specialize in one or more sub-disciplines. Several concepts are essential for the study of chemistry; some of them are:[15]
        
        Matter
        Main article: Matter
        In chemistry, matter is defined as anything that has rest mass and volume (it takes up space) and is made up of particles. The particles that make up matter have rest mass as well – not all particles have rest mass, such as the photon. Matter can be a pure chemical substance or a mixture of substances.[16]
        
        Atom
        Main article: Atom
        
        A diagram of an atom based on the Bohr model
        The atom is the basic unit of chemistry. It consists of a dense core called the atomic nucleus surrounded by a space occupied by an electron cloud. The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons (together called nucleons), while the electron cloud consists of negatively charged electrons which orbit the nucleus. In a neutral atom, the negatively charged electrons balance out the positive charge of the protons. The nucleus is dense; the mass of a nucleon is approximately 1,836 times that of an electron, yet the radius of an atom is about 10,000 times that of its nucleus.[17][18]
        
        The atom is also the smallest entity that can be envisaged to retain the chemical properties of the element, such as electronegativity, ionization potential, preferred oxidation state(s), coordination number, and preferred types of bonds to form (e.g., metallic, ionic, covalent).

    <h2 id="biology">BIOLOGY</h2>
    <p>Biology is the scientific study of life.[1][2][3] It is a natural science with a broad scope but has several
        unifying themes that tie it together as a single, coherent field.[1][2][3] For instance, all organisms are made
        up of cells that process hereditary information encoded in genes, which can be transmitted to future
        generations. Another major theme is evolution, which explains the unity and diversity of life.[1][2][3] Energy
        processing is also important to life as it allows organisms to move, grow, and reproduce.[1][2][3] Finally, all
        organisms are able to regulate their own internal environments.[1][2][3][4][5]

        Biologists are able to study life at multiple levels of organization,[1] from the molecular biology of a cell to
        the anatomy and physiology of plants and animals, and evolution of populations.[1][6] Hence, there are multiple
        subdisciplines within biology, each defined by the nature of their research questions and the tools that they
        use.[7][8][9] Like other scientists, biologists use the scientific method to make observations, pose questions,
        generate hypotheses, perform experiments, and form conclusions about the world around them.[1]

        Life on Earth, which emerged more than 3.7 billion years ago,[10] is immensely diverse. Biologists have sought
        to study and classify the various forms of life, from prokaryotic organisms such as archaea and bacteria to
        eukaryotic organisms such as protists, fungi, plants, and animals. These various organisms contribute to the
        biodiversity of an ecosystem, where they play specialized roles in the cycling of nutrients and energy through
        their biophysical environment.History

        The earliest of roots of science, which included medicine, can be traced to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in around 3000 to 1200 BCE.[11][12] Their contributions shaped ancient Greek natural philosophy.[11][12][13][14] Ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE) contributed extensively to the development of biological knowledge. He explored biological causation and the diversity of life. His successor, Theophrastus, began the scientific study of plants.[15] Scholars of the medieval Islamic world who wrote on biology included al-Jahiz (781–869), Al-Dīnawarī (828–896), who wrote on botany,[16] and Rhazes (865–925) who wrote on anatomy and physiology. Medicine was especially well studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought.
        
        Biology began to quickly develop with Anton van Leeuwenhoek's dramatic improvement of the microscope. It was then that scholars discovered spermatozoa, bacteria, infusoria and the diversity of microscopic life. Investigations by Jan Swammerdam led to new interest in entomology and helped to develop techniques of microscopic dissection and staining.[17] Advances in microscopy had a profound impact on biological thinking. In the early 19th century, biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the now universal ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, although they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells, continuing to support spontaneous generation. However, Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow were able to reify the third tenet, and by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets which consolidated into cell theory.[18][19]
        
        Meanwhile, taxonomy and classification became the focus of natural historians. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735, and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species.[20] Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleable—even suggesting the possibility of common descent.[21]
        
        
        In 1842, Charles Darwin penned his first sketch of On the Origin of Species.[22]
        Serious evolutionary thinking originated with the works of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who presented a coherent theory of evolution.[23] The British naturalist Charles Darwin, combining the biogeographical approach of Humboldt, the uniformitarian geology of Lyell, Malthus's writings on population growth, and his own morphological expertise and extensive natural observations, forged a more successful evolutionary theory based on natural selection; similar reasoning and evidence led Alfred Russel Wallace to independently reach the same conclusions.[24][25]
        
        The basis for modern genetics began with the work of Gregor Mendel in 1865.[26] This outlined the principles of biological inheritance.[27] However, the significance of his work was not realized until the early 20th century when evolution became a unified theory as the modern synthesis reconciled Darwinian evolution with classical genetics.[28] In the 1940s and early 1950s, a series of experiments by Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA by James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s onwards, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. The Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 to map the human genome.[29]
        
        Chemical basis
        Atoms and molecules
        Further information: Chemistry
        All organisms are made up of chemical elements;[30] oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen account for most (96%) of the mass of all organisms, with calcium, phosphorus, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium constituting essentially all the remainder. Different elements can combine to form compounds such as water, which is fundamental to life.[30] Biochemistry is the study of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. Molecular biology is the branch of biology that seeks to understand the molecular basis of biological activity in and between cells, including molecular synthesis, modification, mechanisms, and interactions.
        
        Water
        
        Model of hydrogen bonds (1) between molecules of water
        See also: Planetary habitability, Circumstellar habitable zone, and Water distribution on Earth
        Life arose from the Earth's first ocean, which formed some 3.8 billion years ago.[31] Since then, water continues to be the most abundant molecule in every organism. Water is important to life because it is an effective solvent, capable of dissolving solutes such as sodium and chloride ions or other small molecules to form an aqueous solution. Once dissolved in water, these solutes are more likely to come in contact with one another and therefore take part in chemical reactions that sustain life.[31] In terms of its molecular structure, water is a small polar molecule with a bent shape formed by the polar covalent bonds of two hydrogen (H) atoms to one oxygen (O) atom (H2O).[31] Because the O–H bonds are polar, the oxygen atom has a slight negative charge and the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge.[31] This polar property of water allows it to attract other water molecules via hydrogen bonds, which makes water cohesive.[31] Surface tension results from the cohesive force due to the attraction between molecules at the surface of the liquid.[31] Water is also adhesive as it is able to adhere to the surface of any polar or charged non-water molecules.[31] Water is denser as a liquid than it is as a solid (or ice).[31] This unique property of water allows ice to float above liquid water such as ponds, lakes, and oceans, thereby insulating the liquid below from the cold air above.[31] Water has the capacity to absorb energy, giving it a higher specific heat capacity than other solvents such as ethanol.[31] Thus, a large amount of energy is needed to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules to convert liquid water into water vapor.[31] As a molecule, water is not completely stable as each water molecule continuously dissociates into hydrogen and hydroxyl ions before reforming into a water molecule again.[31] In pure water, the number of hydrogen ions balances (or equals) the number of hydroxyl ions, resulting in a pH that is neutral.
        
        Organic compounds
        Further information: Organic chemistry
        
        Organic compounds such as glucose are vital to organisms.
        Organic compounds are molecules that contain carbon bonded to another element such as hydrogen.[31] With the exception of water, nearly all the molecules that make up each organism contain carbon.[31][32] Carbon can form covalent bonds with up to four other atoms, enabling it to form diverse, large, and complex molecules.[31][32] For example, a single carbon atom can form four single covalent bonds such as in methane, two double covalent bonds such as in carbon dioxide (CO2), or a triple covalent bond such as in carbon monoxide (CO). Moreover, carbon can form very long chains of interconnecting carbon–carbon bonds such as octane or ring-like structures such as glucose.
        
        The simplest form of an organic molecule is the hydrocarbon, which is a large family of organic compounds that are composed of hydrogen atoms bonded to a chain of carbon atoms. A hydrocarbon backbone can be substituted by other elements such as oxygen (O), hydrogen (H), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S), which can change the chemical behavior of that compound.[31] Groups of atoms that contain these elements (O-, H-, P-, and S-) and are bonded to a central carbon atom or skeleton are called functional groups.[31] There are six prominent functional groups that can be found in organisms: amino group, carboxyl group, carbonyl group, hydroxyl group, phosphate group, and sulfhydryl group.[31]
        
        In 1953, the Miller-Urey experiment showed that organic compounds could be synthesized abiotically within a closed system mimicking the conditions of early Earth, thus suggesting that complex organic molecules could have arisen spontaneously in early Earth (see abiogenesis).[33][31</p>
    <h2 id="computer-science">COMPTER-SCIENCE</h2>
    <p>Computer science is the study of computation, automation, and information.[1][2][3] Computer science spans
        theoretical disciplines (such as algorithms, theory of computation, information theory, and automation) to
        practical disciplines (including the design and implementation of hardware and software).[4][5][6] Computer
        science is generally considered an academic discipline and distinct from computer programming which is
        considered to be a technical field.[7]

        Algorithms and data structures are central to computer science.[8] The theory of computation concerns abstract
        models of computation and general classes of problems that can be solved using them. The fields of cryptography
        and computer security involve studying the means for secure communication and for preventing security
        vulnerabilities. Computer graphics and computational geometry address the generation of images. Programming
        language theory considers different ways to describe computational processes, and database theory concerns the
        management of repositories of data. Human–computer interaction investigates the interfaces through which humans
        and computers interact, and software engineering focuses on the design and principles behind developing
        software. Areas such as operating systems, networks and embedded systems investigate the principles and design
        behind complex systems. Computer architecture describes the construction of computer components and
        computer-operated equipment. Artificial intelligence and machine learning aim to synthesize goal-orientated
        processes such as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adaptation, planning and learning found in
        humans and animals. Within artificial intelligence, computer vision aims to understand and process image and
        video data, while natural language processing aims to understand and process textual and linguistic data.

        The fundamental concern of computer science is determining what can and cannot be automated.[2][9][3][10][11]
        The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science.[12][13]History

        Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716) developed logic in a binary number system and has been called the "founder of computer science".[14]
        
        Charles Babbage is sometimes referred to as the "father of computing".[15]
        
        Ada Lovelace published the first algorithm intended for processing on a computer.[16]
        The earliest foundations of what would become computer science predate the invention of the modern digital computer. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tasks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding in computations such as multiplication and division. Algorithms for performing computations have existed since antiquity, even before the development of sophisticated computing equipment.[17]
        
        Wilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first working mechanical calculator in 1623.[18] In 1673, Gottfried Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called the Stepped Reckoner.[19] Leibniz may be considered the first computer scientist and information theorist, because of various reasons, including the fact that he documented the binary number system. In 1820, Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industry[note 1] when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage started the design of the first automatic mechanical calculator, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave him the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, his Analytical Engine.[20] He started developing this machine in 1834, and "in less than two years, he had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer".[21] "A crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system derived from the Jacquard loom"[21] making it infinitely programmable.[note 2] In 1843, during the translation of a French article on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer.[22] Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented the tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistical information; eventually his company became part of IBM. Following Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, Percy Ludgate in 1909 published[23] the 2nd of the only two designs for mechanical analytical engines in history. In 1937, one hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream, Howard Aiken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched card equipment and was also in the calculator business[24] to develop his giant programmable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard Mark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself used cards and a central computing unit. When the machine was finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".[25]
        
        During the 1940s, with the development of new and more powerful computing machines such as the Atanasoff–Berry computer and ENIAC, the term computer came to refer to the machines rather than their human predecessors.[26] As it became clear that computers could be used for more than just mathematical calculations, the field of computer science broadened to study computation in general. In 1945, IBM founded the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University in New York City. The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side was IBM's first laboratory devoted to pure science. The lab is the forerunner of IBM's Research Division, which today operates research facilities around the world.[27] Ultimately, the close relationship between IBM and Columbia University was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific discipline, with Columbia offering one of the first academic-credit courses in computer science in 1946.[28] Computer science began to be established as a distinct academic discipline in the 1950s and early 1960s.[29][30] The world's first computer science degree program, the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in 1953. The first computer science department in the United States was formed at Purdue University in 1962.[31] Since practical computers became available, many applications of computing have become distinct areas of study in their own rights.</p>
